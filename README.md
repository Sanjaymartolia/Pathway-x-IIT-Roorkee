# GenAI based RAG Application by Pathway & IIT Roorkee
Develop a real-time or static RAG-based LLM application completely using Pathway LLM App templates or Pathway with Llamaindex / Pathway with Langchain.
This demo shows how to create a RAG application using Pathway that provides always up-to-date knowledge to your LLM without the need for a separate ETL.
This demo allows you to:
- 📂 **Set up a vector store** for real-time indexing of documents from Google Drive, Microsoft 365 SharePoint, or local directories.
- 🤖 **Integrate an OpenAI LLM** with your knowledge base for seamless access to intelligent responses.
- 🎯 **Receive accurate and precise answers** to your queries with high-quality information.
- 🗂️ **Easily ask questions** about specific folders, files, or all documents using powerful filtering options.
- ✍️ **Use LLMs via API** to automatically summarize large texts.
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Get an executive summary** from multiple files, giving you a quick overview of all relevant knowledge.

  ## How it works (Understanding RAG pipeline)
- 📄 **app.py**: The main application code, written in Python, using Pathway.
- 🛠️ **app.yaml**: Configuration file for data sources, OpenAI LLM model, and the web server. Customize this to modify the LLM model, use Google Drive data, or adjust filesystem directories for indexing.
- 📋 **requirements.txt**: Contains dependencies for the pipeline. Use with `pip install -r` to set up the environment locally.
- 🐋 **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration for running the pipeline inside a container.
- 🗝️ **.env**: Environment variables configuration file where the OpenAI key is stored.
- 📁 **data/**: A folder with example files for running test cases.
  
- 📄 **app.py**:

  **Google Connector**: https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/connect/connectors/gdrive-connector
The section config must contain two main parameters:
**object_id**, containing the ID of the folder that needs to be indexed. It can be found from the URL in the web interface, where it's the last part of the address. For example, the publicly available demo folder in Google Drive has the URL https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cULDv2OaViJBmOfG5WB0oWcgayNrGtVs. Consequently, the last part of this address is 1cULDv2OaViJBmOfG5WB0oWcgayNrGtVs, hence this is the object_id you would need to specify.
**service_user_credentials_file**, containing the path to the credentials files for the Google service account. To get more details on setting up the service account and getting credentials, you can also refer to this tutorial.
